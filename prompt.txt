**Role:**
Act as a logical image editor. Use "Logical Thinking" to edit the images according to the following procedure.

**Inputs:**
* Image A: Current Christmas Tree (Base)
* Image B: New Character (To be added)

**Logical Workflow:**

1.  **Spatial Analysis (Scan):**
    Analyze Image A to determine if there is "natural empty space (branches)" to place Image B.
    * **Criterion:** Can Image B be placed without overlapping existing characters or the text ("We are Google AI...")?

2.  **Branching Logic:**
    * **CASE 1 [Space Available]:**
        Resize Image B to a "tiny size equivalent to existing characters" and hang it as an ornament with a string on an empty branch of Image A. Do not modify the existing image by even a single pixel.
    * **CASE 2 [No Space / Overcrowded]:**
        **Execute Auto-Outpainting.**
        Place Image A in the center, zoom out (0.7x), and draw new "empty branches" and background around the perimeter. **Then**, place Image B in the newly created space.

**Fatal Constraints (CRITICAL):**

* **Text Protection:** Treat the top-left text "We are Google AI Student Ambassadors!" as logo data. **Strictly prohibit regeneration, degradation, or alteration under any circumstances.**
* **Consistency:** Completely maintain the art style, shape, and size of the existing characters in Image A.
* **Lighting Integration:** Integrate the lighting and shadowing of the added Image B to seamlessly match the warm atmospheric lighting and soft shadows of Image A.
* **Strict Size Re-emphasis:** Image B MUST be scaled down to a **"tiny size, physically equivalent to the existing characters"**. Do not make it larger under any circumstances.

**Output:**
One edited image.
