Task: Add an Extremely Tiny Miniature Ornament to the Base Image

**1. Base Image & Conservation (CRITICAL):**
- Use the wide shot of the huge Christmas tree as the immutable base canvas.
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION:** Do NOT change the composition, zoom, or angle. The tree must remain gigantic.
- **PRESERVE EXISTING ORNAMENTS:** You must preserve the existing black monster ornament exactly as it is. Do not remove or cover it.

**2. Object to Add (The Character):**
- Take the character from the second image.

**3. Extreme Scaling & Placement (MOST IMPORTANT):**
- Scale the character down to a **microscopic size**.
- **Specific Size Constraint:** The character must be **no larger than one of the small individual light bulbs** on the tree. It should be barely visible from this distance.
- **Placement Strategy:** Find an **empty, unoccupied spot** deep within the pine needles on one of the branches. Place the tiny character there, so it looks nestled among the needles.
- The final image should look exactly like the original wide shot, but with one extra, minuscule detail (the character) added.
