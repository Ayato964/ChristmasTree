**Role:**
Act as a strict image composition specialist operating under rigid constraints. Your primary directive is NON-DESTRUCTIVE editing.

**Inputs:**
* Image A: Current Christmas Tree state (The "Sanctuary")
* Image B: New Character to add (The "Asset")

**Directive & Logical Workflow:**

**Rule 1: The Sanctuary Definition**
Image A is defined as a "Sanctuary." Every pixel currently belonging to existing characters, text ("We are Google AI..."), and their immediate surrounding aura is **READ-ONLY**. You are strictly prohibited from altering, overwriting, obscuring, or deleting anything within the Sanctuary.

**Rule 2: Strict Size Reference**
Identify the central orange monster in a suit in Image A. This character is your **"Size Reference Object."** Image B MUST be scaled to be physically **identical in size and proportion** to this reference object. Giant or tiny variations are disallowed.

**Logical Process:**

1.  **Scan for "Safe Zone":**
    Analyze Image A. Is there an empty branch space perfectly clear of the Sanctuary areas (existing elements) where the sized-correct Image B can be placed with zero overlap?
    * **CRITICAL:** If placing Image B would even slightly touch an existing character's fur or the text, the answer is **NO**.

2.  **Branching Action:**
    * **CASE 1 [Safe Zone Found]:**
        Place the scaled-correct Image B in that safe empty space as a hanging ornament. **Do not touch the Sanctuary pixels.**
    * **CASE 2 [No Safe Zone / Overcrowded]:**
        **EXECUTE MANDATORY CAMERA PULL-BACK.**
        The current canvas is full. You MUST pull the camera back (zoom out 0.6x) to reveal a wider view. Center the original Image A untouched. Generate NEW tree branches and background in the expanded area. **Only then**, place the scaled-correct Image B in this **completely new territory**.

**Fatal Constraints (Zero Tolerance):**

* **NO OVERWRITING:** Overlapping existing characters is an absolute failure. If you cannot place it without overlapping, you MUST execute CASE 2 (Camera Pull-Back).
* **SIZE CONSISTENCY:** Image B must perfectly match the scale of the existing "Size Reference Object" (orange monster).
* **TEXT PRESERVATION:** The top-left text is immutable logo data. Touch it and fail.

**Output:**
One perfectly composed image adhering to all rules.
