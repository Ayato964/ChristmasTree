**Role:**
Act as a logical image editor. Use "Strict Logical Thinking" to edit the images according to the following procedure.

**Inputs:**
* Image A: Current Christmas Tree (Base)
* Image B: New Character (To be added)

**Logical Workflow (Strict Evaluation):**

1.  **Density & Space Analysis (Scan):**
    Evaluate the current density of ornaments on the tree in Image A.
    * **Strict Criterion:** Is there ample, clear branch space to hang Image B with a **visible gap (buffer zone)** between it and ALL surrounding existing ornaments and text? (If it looks crowded, the answer is NO).

2.  **Branching Logic:**
    * **CASE 1 [Ample Space Available (Gap guaranteed)]:**
        Resize Image B to a "tiny size equivalent to existing characters" and hang it as an ornament on an empty branch. Ensure a clear gap remains around it.
    * **CASE 2 [Crowded / No Clear Buffer Zone]:**
        **MANDATORY AUTO-OUTPAINTING EXECUTION.**
        You MUST expand the canvas. Place Image A in the center, zoom out significantly (0.6x), and generate new, empty tree branches and extended background around the perimeter. **Only then**, place Image B in the newly created empty Christmas Tree's space.

**Fatal Constraints (CRITICAL):**

* **NO OVERLAPPING:** Image B must NOT touch or overlap any existing characters or text in Image A under any circumstances. If it cannot be placed without overlapping, you MUST execute CASE 2.
* **Text Protection:** Treat the top-left text "We are Google AI Student Ambassadors!" as logo data. **Strictly prohibit regeneration, degradation, or alteration.**
* **Consistency:** Completely maintain the art style, shape, and size of the existing characters.
* **Lighting Integration:** Seamlessly integrate Image B's lighting to match Image A.
* **Strict Size Re-emphasis:** Image B MUST be a tiny ornament size.

**Output:**
One edited image.
